# PhysicsSimulation
A basic 2D physics simulation with javafx.
A weekend proyect to learn the javafx library and remember the basics of physics.
The aim was to make use of common design patterns to make the code as modular and maintainable as possible.

The funcitonalities added till now are:
* **Nodes** 
    * **Speed, direction and forces**
    * **Mass** 
    * **Gravity** 
    * **Drag**
    * **Out of bounds bounces** 
    * **Elasticity**
    * **Fixed Nodes**

* **Springs**
    * **Stiffness**
    * **Rest Length**

 * **Ropes**
    * **Stiffness**
    * **Dampening**
    * **Length**
